# ml-task-4
Wind Turbine Scada Performance Analysis
Dataset Provided Columns: 

Date/Time 

LV ActivePower (kW) 

Wind Speed (m/s) 

Theoretical_Power_Curve (kWh) 

Wind Direction (°) 

Task 1 — EDA  

Plot the time-series trend for all four parameters and identify any missing or abnormal readings. 

Visualize the relationship between Wind Speed and LV ActivePower using a scatterplot to observe the basic power curve behavior. 

Task 2 — Supervised Learning (Time-Series Forecasting for ALL 4 Variables) 

Convert the dataset into a time-series format and prepare windowed data. 

Build time-series forecasting models to predict: 

LV ActivePower (kW) 

Wind Speed (m/s) 

Theoretical Power Curve (kWh) 

Wind Direction (°) 

Train and test the forecasting models and evaluate using suitable error metrics. 

Plot the predicted vs actual values for all four variables. 

 

 

Task 3 — Unsupervised Learning  

Anomaly Detection in Power Generation - Detect abnormal points where actual power deviates strongly from the theoretical power curve (underperformance detection). 

Task 4 — AI Task  

AI Turbine Performance Score Generator 

Calculate a performance score using the ratio of actual power vs theoretical power. 

Scale the score between 0–100. 

Categorize the turbine state as Good / Moderate / Poor. 

Produce a simple automated suggestion based on the score. 

Task 5: Deep Learning 

 Develop a CNN classifier for a multiimage dagtaste dataset with visual results 

Objective: Develop a CNN classifier model for any multi-image “dagtaste” dataset and provide results in visuals. 

Deliverables: Confusion matrix, sample predictions grid, and Grad-CAM overlays visualizing model decisions.
